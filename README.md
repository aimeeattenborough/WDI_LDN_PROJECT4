### Overview
For the final project, we were instructed to build a full-stack MERN application, utilising MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.

### The Application

For my application I wanted to create a version of Instagram, but with a difference. Instead of beautiful people in exotic locations, I wanted to make a version which celebrated the exceptionally ordinary and the visually mediocre -- a place to share the most boring snaps and unremarkable snaps in your collection.

### Features

Users are directed to a registration page on on page load which shows a blurb and 'reviews' of the site. Upon registering, users are directed to an uninspiring feed of pictures where they can like the dullest photos, downvote those that they judge are too mildly interesting, and comment on them. Users can view profile pages, to follow other users, and view their likes and dislikes.
